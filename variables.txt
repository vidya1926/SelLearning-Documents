When we declare a variable , it will create a space in the memory
Memory space allocated to a variable is depending on the type of variable we are declaring.


Let us see the memory allocation for variables at the last of this session

Syntax


Scope is that area of the program where the variable is visible to a program and can be used (accessible).
 i.e. the scope of variable determines its accessibility for other parts of program.

Java allows declaring variables within any block. 
A block defines a scope that starts with an opening curly brace and ends with a closing curly brace.


It means that a variable defined within the block loses its value when scope is ended.
the lifetime of any variable is confined to its scope.


ThusReference variables are the variables which points the reference object/ value â€“like class object,
Classes, interfaces, arrays, enumerations, and, annotations are reference types in Java.,
